# This file lists the Python packages required for the PyInstaller build environment
# when creating the Windows installer for ANPE Studio.
# It is NOT the requirements file used by the installer itself at runtime on the user's machine.

# --- Core Packaging Tool ---
PyInstaller>=6.0.0 # Or your specific preferred version

# --- GUI Framework (used by setup_windows.pyw and its views/widgets) ---
PyQt6>=6.0.0       # For the installer's GUI

# --- Windows-specific functionality (used by setup_windows.pyw) ---
winshell>=0.6.0    # For creating shortcuts, accessing special folders etc.
pyshortcuts>=1.0.0 # For creating shortcuts (alternative or complementary to winshell)

# Note: Other libraries like 'requests' are not directly imported by the
# installer scripts (setup_windows.pyw, installer_core.py) or launcher.py.
# The installer_core.py uses urllib.request for its own downloads and then
# uses the bundled Python's pip to install packages from 'installer/windows_requirements.txt'
# into the *target* installed environment.
